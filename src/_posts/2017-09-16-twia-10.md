Version 0.5.1 was released! A lot of work was done during this year.

## What's cooking on develop?

### Notable additions

* Input system has been even further refactored to be event driven and generic by [@Xaeroxe][xr] in [#385](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/385)
* Specs aware renderer pipeline added by [@omni-viral][ov] in [#317](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/317)
* ECS bundles added by [@Rhuagh][rh] in [#364](https://github.com/amethyst/amethyst/pull/364) (These bundle up related components and resources,
making it easier to get started with amethyst.)

### Breaking changes

* Asset management was rewritten by [@torkley][tc]
* RON instead of YAML is used as config format thanks to [@torkleyy][tc]
* Input system was overhauled by [@Xaeroxe][xr]

## Calls for participation

up to date, any help here would be greatly appreciated!
